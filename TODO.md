# TO-DO

Before we have 100 links I will think in making this programmatically: every
link will be a toml file (filename will be the slug-uid) and the toml will
contain title, description and link etc.

Also to generate a html in GH pages.

Maybe with screenshots for softwares.

And maybe we post PDF resources and theory cheatsheets on the repository.

But for while we will keep adding resources inside markdown tables.
